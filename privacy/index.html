    <h1>Privacy Policy — Orbiters</h1>
    <p class="muted"><strong>Effective date:</strong> 2026-01-11</p>

    <p>
      Orbiters is a 3D Solar System explorer designed for beautiful, interactive discovery.
      This Privacy Policy explains what data Orbiters collects and how it is used.
    </p>

    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Orbiters does not collect personal data.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Orbiters does not use analytics, ads, or tracking.</strong></li>
      <li>Your app data is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
    <p>
      Orbiters does not collect, transmit, sell, or share personal information.
      We do not require accounts, and we do not run our own servers for user data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Stored on Your Device</h2>
    <p>
      Orbiters stores app preferences (such as display settings) and any locally cached content
      <strong>only on your device</strong>, so you can use the app smoothly.
    </p>

    <h2>External Links</h2>
    <p>
      Orbiters may include links to third-party websites (for example, reference sources).
      Opening these links is optional and happens outside the app. Orbiters does not control
      third-party sites or their privacy practices.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Orbiters does not integrate third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
    </p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>

      Orbiters is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal data from children.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Choices & Data Deletion</h2>
    <p>
      Because your data stays on your device, you can reset settings within the app (if available),
      or remove the app to delete all locally stored data.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If Orbiters’ privacy practices change, this Privacy Policy may be updated.
